# hello-world

Hi! I'm Christian Bravo a Guatemalan Frontend developer and I welcome you to my first post. It's a great pleasure to have you here!

Honestly, a couple of days ago I couldn't imagine that I'm writing this right now. This started out of curiosity, when I started experimenting with <a target="_blank" href="https://content.nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt Content</a>. And after a couple of ideas and inspiration from <a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/shots">Dribbble</a>, here I am.

But, the 3 main reasons that really motivate me to create this blog are the following:

## .Teaching-is-the-best-way-to-learn {

Over time, I've found that when you have the opportunity to teach something (no matter what it's) to someone else, you get amazing rewards like:

- ... reveal gaps in you knowledge
- ... get valuable feedback from others
- ... will make you think different
- ... build a reputation as someone who is a giver

Therefore, If I can reach out to at least one person and provide them educational resources, tutorials or any positive thing to help them, I'll feel like I have achieved my goal.

## }

## #Show-my-interests-skills-and-have-fun {

I would like to demonstrate the skills that I have acquired by doing what I enjoy. Also, I want to have a space where I can express myself freely, writing about things that I am passionate about and that amuse me.

## }

## h2.Improve-my-written-communication-skills {

Since I can remember, I've always had difficulties expressing and transmitting complex and abstract ideas in a simple way. Also, at the moment that I am writing this, I am improving my English writing skills, therefore writing is one of the best exercises for me.

## }

Here I hope write about software development, web technologies and many interesting things.

Thanks for reading my first post. You don't know how special it is to finally be able to reach other people with my words :)
